## Genome-wide cell-free DNA fragmentation in patients with cancer
#### Cristiano et al. 2019


##### TLDR:
- Developed method to analyze cfDNA fragmentation patterns genome-wide.

- Healthy individuals - cfDNA fragmentation mirrors nucleosome organization in white blood cells.
- Petients with cancer - shows disrupted fragmentation patterns.

    Tested method on 236 cancer patients and 245 healthy.

- ML model:
    - sensitivity 57-99%, specificity 98%
    - AUC: 0.94 -   high accuracy
    - could identify tissue of origin 75% of cases
