With:
~200 samples
SVM with default parameters
No aggressive regularization mentioned

This would:
Overfit perfectly
Be numerically unstable
Make PCA itself infeasible (covariance matrix would be impossible)

So the method would literally not run, let alone generalize.



To avoid repeating this confusion, you should write something like:

“For each cfDNA fragmentation pattern, a separate feature matrix was constructed and standardized. Dimensionality reduction and classification were performed independently for each pattern. The resulting prediction probabilities were then combined to form an ensemble classifier.”
This will immediately signal that you understand the pipeline correctly.



+ we want to stack samples -> 200samples: get df_pfe to look like (200, 561k)
